    "foodHistoryContext": "Aloo Ke Gutke, a popular Indian dish, has a fascinating history of ingredients that traveled from around the world to India through trade, colonization, and cultural exchange. Potatoes, originally from South America, were brought to India by Portuguese traders in the 16th century. Tomatoes, introduced by Portuguese from the Americas, added a burst of flavor to Indian cuisine. Chilies, introduced by Portuguese from Mexico and South America, brought the heat. Paneer, with techniques from Middle Eastern and Persian influence, became an integral part of Indian dairy. Onions, arriving via Central Asian trade routes, and garlic, from ancient Mediterranean trade, added depth to Indian cooking. The soya chunks, with Chinese influence, provided a plant-based protein source. Aloo Ke Gutke represents this beautiful fusion of global ingredients that became 'Indian' over time, and our healthy modifications continue this ancient tradition."
